## Self Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm zenenznze, currently pursuing my undergraduate degree. I have a strong interest in the Internet and computer technology, and I aspire to make my own contributions in this field. I enjoy exploring new technologies and am eager to share and learn from others. I believe that open-source projects are an excellent way to learn and grow, so I hope to find more interesting open-source projects on GitHub and collaborate with other developers to exchange ideas, learn, and work together.

I have good teamwork and problem-solving skills, and I am adept at communication and collaboration. During my university years, I actively participated in various projects and activities, constantly improving my technical skills and soft skills. I am eager to meet like-minded partners in the open-source community to explore and create more exciting technological achievements together.

In addition to technology, I also value continuous learning and personal growth. I constantly strive for improvement and am open to challenges and new opportunities. I believe that through continuous learning and practice, I can continuously improve myself and become a better developer and team member.

Thank you for taking the time to read my self-introduction. I look forward to learning, growing, and creating together with you in the open-source community.
